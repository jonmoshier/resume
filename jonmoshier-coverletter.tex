\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}
 
I understand you're busy in the hunt for a new software engineer and I appreciate you taking your time to consider me as a potential candidate. I'd like to take a moment to tell you a little bit about my background. 
	
I've been working as a professional software developer for the last 6+ years at a small healthcare startup based out of Washington D.C. We build tools that allow oncologists to study patient datasets and make better informed decisions regarding cancer treatments.

While we're primarily a .net shop, I'm fairly agnostic when it comes to the tools I use and the domains I'm working in. I consider myself a full-stack developer and I'm just as happy writing SQL as I am working on the front-end. Of course, being a generalist has its downsides but I feel comfortable being thrown at most any problem.

My current work has been very rewarding but I can't help but wonder what's next in my career. Please review my resume and contact me to further discuss the opportunity.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
\closing{Thanks,}
